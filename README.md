# Particles-moving.js

Particles-moving.js is a simple movement simulator for particles.

Particles experience a stronger or weaker pull towards the area in which they were generated, but are also more or less attracted and/or repulsed by other points known as attractors.

Particles-moving.js is created in javascript and is dependent on the following libraries: p5.js, p5.voronoi.js and rhill-voronoi-core.js.

## Installation

Make sure to include particles-moving.js, index.html, and /libraries. Run the simulator by viewing index.html in a browser.

## Usage

This simulator may be used to observe the movement of particles and to ponder about their behavior, motivations and the agency of the attractors inasmuch as they ultimately come to influence the trajectories of particles.
